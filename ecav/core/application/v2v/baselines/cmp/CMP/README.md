[Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10908648) | [Project page](https://cmp-cooperative-prediction.github.io/) | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17916) 

This repository contains the official implementation of paper "CMP: Cooperative Motion Prediction with Multi-Agent Communication".

## Features

![](docs/fig2.png)

**1) Practical, Latency-robust Framework for Cooperative Motion Prediction**: our framwork integrates cooperative perception with trajectory prediction, marking a pioneering effort in the realm of connected and automated vehicles, which enables CAVs to share and fuse data from LiDAR point clouds to improve object detection, tracking, and motion prediction.

**2) Attention-based Prediction Aggregation**: prediction aggregator take advantage of the predictions shared by other CAVs, which improves prediction accuracy. This mechanism is scalable and can effectively handle varying numbers of CAVs.

**3) State-of-the-art Performance in cooperative prediction under practical settings on the OPV2V and V2V4Real datasets**: our framwork evaluated on both simulated V2V datasets and real world V2V scenarios, and outperforms the cooperative perception and prediction network proposed by the strongest baseline V2VNet.
